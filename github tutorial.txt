You have a code
Initialize it as a git repository -git init
there are 2 terminology in stash and commit
Stash=> when we develop something, this commit accept the file from stash(first level of commit)
commit(last level in commit)
Note:When we push code to github , first it goes to stash and then it will goes to commit.

How to add your file to the stash/staging?
git add *
or git ass filename
After this , entire code will be moved into the stash and then check the status by below command

& check git status
git status
it tell us about the file added or placed in the stash


How to commit to github?
git commit -m "comment"
-m is used for message
After this ,all our code will be at the commit place and we are all set to push our code
to github account from this place.

This is how  we have to come step by step.


Next , we have to push our code to github that is origin.
it will be done by using connection.
git remote add origin  paste link of github
Now remote repository is successfully connected to local repository
Next step is to push our code which is to remote location
git push origin master
Later we will discuss about the master branch and subbranch
It will ask you for github credential for first time
when we want to push something to github account , then we have to tell to the github people about our account .

in real time, company would provide you one link for github .
we have to ask company to get that link


How to clone project from github?
Clone  the project in another machine
git clone =>it  is something which is used to extract the repository for the first time.
command
git clone "link of github"

WHy we are saying first time?
Later if you or person from different country  want to get that code , you will use pull command

Lets say, if you are working on some project and if you have already git availabel with you.
Then you need not to clone it completey
We required latest changes.
The lastest change can be updated by using pull command
command
git pull origin master


How to move or merge develop branch into master?
Master is taking care of regression changes & this one is taking care of  framework.
Lets merge and build a powerfull framework

git merge <branchname>
to merge different branch into active branch
git add *
git status
git commit -m "final commit "
git push origin master
After this , we will go to other person branch and pull everything in our machine by using
git pull origin master
so it will pull the latest changes in the local repository from central repository


How to move or merge develop branch into master?
How to resolve Merge conflict with GIT?
For that , we have to talk manually with team people and delete that line of code in our develop2 branch .


Github part-2
1.Install git
2.git –version
3.pwd
4.cd filename
5.git init =(to create empty repository)
6.git add .
7git status
8.git commit -m “first commit”
9.git status(to check if added or not)
10.Establish conncetion(goto github and create repository)
11.create repository
12.copy link and paste in cmd
13.push the code.

14.if you are commiting for first time,it will ask you to configure your account (usermail or username).
